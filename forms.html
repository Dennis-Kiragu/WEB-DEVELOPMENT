<p class="one kk">Single mums who will read this hugs I love you because I was born and raised by single mother. But allow me speak to you about something that I feel very vital and as well let me say sorry to whoever will get hurt because of this article.

 POINT

As per TIFA polls the percentage of young children aged between 14 to 25 years under single mothers perishing because of mob injustice and police bullet  because of crime  has  increased by 20%.

This is happening because today's single mothers don't know how to hide their struggles or challenges from their children,  I can remember growing under my mum who was single mum and there is no single day she ever sat us down to tell us bills she couldn't pay and why she couldn't pay them.
